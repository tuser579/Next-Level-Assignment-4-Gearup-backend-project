## 🎯 Key Rules

- **Roles**: Each project has 3 fixed roles. Users select during registration.
- **Payment**: Payment integration is **MANDATORY**. You must integrate either **Stripe** or **SSLCommerz** for processing payments. Include endpoints for creating payment intents/sessions, handling payment confirmations, and tracking payment status.
- **No Frontend Required**: This is a backend-only assignment. Test your API via Postman/Thunder Client.
- **Flexibility**: Endpoints listed in each variant are examples. Modify as needed.
